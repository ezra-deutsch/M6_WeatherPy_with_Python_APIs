# WeatherPy - Module 6 - Challenge

## Overview of Project

WeatherPy had us combine API calls with Pandas to create a travel app. The app is able to ask the user what type of weather they would like to experience on their vacation, and it produces a list of suggested hotels in the cities that match their criteria. The app goes one step further and allows the user to build a road trip with multiple stops.

### Purpose

The purpose of this challenge is to tie together all the skills that we have learned in the Python unit. For Loops, Pandas dataframes, images with Matplotlib, and API calls from OpenWeatherMap and Google.

### Results

Set desired temperature parameters.
(Insert "Travel_Interface_Questions")

Output map of available locations.
(Insert "WeatherPy_vacation_map_a")

Travel Map.
(Insert "WeatherPy_travel_map")

Travel Map including Hotel names.
